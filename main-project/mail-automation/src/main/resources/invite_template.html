    <p>Hi [Client's Name],</p>

    <p>I’m interested in building a free website for you. I’m Jesus, a developer with over 15 years of experience. I’m
        excited to let you know that I’m launching my own web design business with my team of professional
        designers.</p>

    <p>I’m reaching out because I’m offering a few select businesses the chance to have a custom-designed professional
        website made by us at no cost to you. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your online presence, this is the
        perfect opportunity to do so. Feel free to check out some of our work <a

                style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">
            <b>here</b></a>.</p>

    <p>As a small business ourselves, your business is not just another number for us. Every project gets personal
        attention, and your satisfaction is our top priority.</p>

    <p>If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, just reply to this email with a simple "Yes, I want a free
        website!" and let me know if you have hosting already or not. I’ll add you to the waiting list, and we’ll take
        it from there.</p>

    <p>I’d love the chance to work with you.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
